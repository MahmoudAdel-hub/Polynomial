# Compare Between Normal Equation ,Gradient Descent and Polynomial library For <mark> Non Linear Data </mark>
### When Data is in Different Ranges ,we should do <mark>Features Scaling</mark> if we will use Gradient Descent 
### in Normal Equation Using Real Values without doing Featues Scaling , Normal Equation 
$$ 
({X^TX})^{-1}{X^T}y 
$$
### The SameThing with Polynomial Library
